# SDEV435
This is the repository for my Champlain College SDEV-435 project. The project is a visitor management system for a desktop application. It is written in Java Swing and uses Eclipse for the IDE. Data is kept in a SQL database that is only accessible to those authorized according to Champlain College.

Contributions are not currently accepted, as this is a school assignment.
